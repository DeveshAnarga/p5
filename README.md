MongoDB-Powered Data Management with RESTful API and Cloud Deployment

In this project, I spearheaded the technical implementation of events, crafting a robust Mongoose Schema with required fields and validators.
My role included designing and executing RESTful API endpoints for event management, covering addition, listing, and deletion by ID. 
Collaborating with a teammate, we integrated our components for categories and events, ensuring a cohesive system. Crucially, 
I adeptly transitioned previous assingment's endpoints to MongoDB operations, allowing events to be associated with multiple categories.
The successful deployment on GCP, with public IP accessibility, marked the culmination of our technical efforts.
